# Simple-To-Do-List
A simple To-DO List using KnockoutJS

This is a purely client-side To-Do List App which has been developed using KnockoutJs Library.

This has basic functions-

* Add a Task
* Edit a Task
* Mark it as Completed
* Delete the Task

You can extend it with even more functinality and features with a back-end also.Feel free to do so.

The basic styles applied to this are by using siimple css framework(http://siimple.juanes.xyz/).

I developed this as I was learning KnockoutJs.
